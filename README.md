# stripline-pickup-samtec
This is a KiCad project for designing a strip-line pickup with samtec connectors for capacitively coupled LAPPD


# libraries and footprints
I've created a library called stripline-pickup-samtec.pretty to hold all custom footprints. Make sure to import/add this library to the project if it does not show up on first load. Please add all footprints that the board depends on to this library so that this repository is stand-alone. Footprint files may be saved in the "footprints" folder.
